Auto Setup
</h1>

# Description

Automates the setup of my personal Linux machine (Fedora Netinstall) using Ansible and GNU Stow.

# Usage

Should only be executed on Fedora Netinstall

```bash
$ curl "https://location-of-bash-script." | bash -c
```

# TODO:

- [ ] Split the main playbook to multiple other playbooks (i.e., make it modular)
