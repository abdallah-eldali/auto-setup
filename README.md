## Personal Dotfiles

Should only be executed on Fedora Netinstall

```bash
$ curl "https://location-of-bash-script." | bash -c
```

## TODO:

- Split the main playbook to multiple other playbooks (i.e., make it modular)
- Remove some of the sway conf.d/ files
- Flatpak permission files
- Create bash script to install ansible (w/dnf) and ansible-pull the repo in a diff location
- Ansible: create Password folder, create .snapshots and create a snapshot before and after?, how to remove the localhost warning? Use Debug messages
